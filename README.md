==========

My configs for Team Fortress 2.

Based on **tf2compconfiguration** https://code.google.com/p/tf2compconfiguration/ (*originally by Daniel Harvey*)
I am using Chris's highquality config https://github.com/tf2configs/tf2configs

Editing the config files
-------------------------

If you are using [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for editing the config files, I recommend you to use my user defined language. It creates syntax hihglighting for `.cfg` files making it much more readable.
You can download it from here: http://jimmorrison723.hu/egyebek/cfg-notepad-hoz/
Here's a picture how does it look like : [Picture](http://jimmorrison723.hu/downloads/pictures/cfg.PNG)

How to install:

 * Install the latest Notepad++
 * Download the `xml` file from my website (*Right click on `.cfg Notepad++-hoz` on the bottom of the page, than Save as...*)
 * In Notepad++ go to `Language->Define your language`
 * Click on Import...
 * Choose the `xml` file what you just downloaded
